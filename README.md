# netflix-clone

This application (a Netflix clone) was build using React as a frontend, Firestore as a backend/database and styled-components for the styling.
There is 4 main pages tat you can visit : a Main page, a Sign Up page, a Sign In page and a Browse page where you can find films and series.
All the pages besides the main page are protected routes, using Firestore Authentification to manage the authentification of the user.
